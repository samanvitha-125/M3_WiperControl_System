# ABSTRACT

Rainwater, dust, and exhaust gas compounds from vehicles that adhere to the surface of an automobile windshield are unlikely to be a problem as long as the driver has a clear view of the road. 
However, if the adhering chemicals are not dealt with, they will pose a danger to travel safety.

A windshield wiper system consists of two wiper arms and a wiper drive. The drive drives the two wiper arms over the windshield at an angle to give the driver and passenger a good view. 
The ideal cleaning outcome is ensured by an uniquely formed rubber wiping lip. 

Wipers are extremely important for driver visibility. If the wipers aren't working, the car is considered unsafe. The front wiper motor and transmission mechanism (linkage) are located underneath the windshield, under the cowl panel cover.
