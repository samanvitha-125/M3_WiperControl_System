# ABSTRACT

Rainwater, dust, and exhaust gas compounds from vehicles that adhere to the surface of an automobile windshield are unlikely to be a problem as long as the driver has a clear view of the road. 
However, if the adhering chemicals are not dealt with, they will pose a danger to travel safety.

A windshield wiper system consists of two wiper arms and a wiper drive. The drive drives the two wiper arms over the windshield at an angle to give the driver and passenger a good view. 
The ideal cleaning outcome is ensured by an uniquely formed rubber wiping lip. 

Wipers are extremely important for driver visibility. If the wipers aren't working, the car is considered unsafe. The front wiper motor and transmission mechanism (linkage) are located underneath the windshield, under the cowl panel cover.

# Wiper Control System

## Description

 - A Wiper Control System for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions.It useful in the automotive unit the main purpose of the system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.

## Features

 * If the User button is pressed Once, the red LED will be on    
 
 * If the User Button is pressed TWICE, Blue,Green,Orange LED's come ON at a time with set of frequency

 * If the User Button is pressed THIRD time, ON All LED's in CLOCKWISE manner an speeed will increase 

 * If the User Button is pressed FOURTH time ,all LED's on anticlock manner

 * If the User Button is pressed FIFTH time, the red LED will be off

## State of art

 * The main focus point is seeing the wiper control of the car.
 * And also seeing the seep of the wiper system in the car
 * Now this two features are explained in these project

# 5W's & 1H

# Low Level Requirements

| ID | Description | REQUIREMENT | Status (Implemented/Future) |
| ------ | --------- | ------ | ----- |
| LR01 | WIPER COMES TO INITIAL POSITION AFTER HIS WORK | LED |  IMPLEMENTED  |
| LR02 | PROPER SUPPLY TO PINS AND BOARD | POWER SUPPLY | IMPLEMENTED |
| LR03 | ON AND OFF SWITCH MECHANISM FOR ACTIVATION AND DEACTIVATION OF WIPER BLADES  | SWITCH | IMPLEMENTED |

## Best Methods To Be Followed

* Used functions to decrease dependency on main function
* Used Functions to accept the inputs from environmental conditions and store the values which helped in creating easy design of the system.
* comments have been placed only wherever necessary to avoid confusions
* Created header file so that the fuctions can be used else where ever required without any difficulty
