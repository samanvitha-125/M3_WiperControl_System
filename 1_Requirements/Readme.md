## State of art

 * The main focus point is seeing the wiper control of the car.
 * And also seeing the seep of the wiper system in the car
 * Now this two features are explained in these project

# 5W's & 1H

# High Level Requirements

| ID | High Level Requirements |
| -------- | -------------- |

| HLR2 | It will start the wiper |
| HLR3 | It shall seen speed of the wiper work |
| HLR4 | It will stop the wiper |
| HLR5 | It will stop the car |

# Low Level Requirements

| ID | Low Level Requirements for HLR1|     
| ----- | ----- | 
| LLR1.1 | If the User button is pressed Once, the red LED will be on |      

| ID | Low Level Requirements for HLR2|
| ----- | ----- |
| LLR2.1 | If the User Button is pressed TWICE, Blue,Green,Orange LED's come ON at a time with set of frequency |

| ID | Low Level Requirements for HLR3|

| ID | Low Level Requirements for HLR5|
| -------- | -------------- |
| LLR5.1 | If the User Button is pressed FIFTH time, the red LED will be off |

## Best Methods To Be Followed

* Used functions to decrease dependency on main function
* Used Functions to accept the inputs from environmental conditions and store the values which helped in creating easy design of the system.
* comments have been placed only wherever necessary to avoid confusions
* Created header file so that the fuctions can be used else where ever required without any difficulty
